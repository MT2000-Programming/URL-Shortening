## 📌 Overview
This is my solution for the [Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).  
The project is a responsive landing page that integrates with the [Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/docs) to shorten links and display them dynamically.
